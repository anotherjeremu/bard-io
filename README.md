bard.io attempts to teach you basic music theory in a fun way.

This project was created as part of the first Odin game jam. To keep the sccope manageable, we decided to replicate an input mechanic from old chord guessing games, embedded in a story type setting to make it a bit more playful.

The wizard/monk can't be battled yet, because the game state isnt managed that well yet. Still need to refactor some stuff..
